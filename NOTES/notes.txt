Keep Track of Form Information:

Imagine each input field (like a text box for a username or email) is like a box where users put their information. Formik helps you keep track of what's in those boxes.
Make Sure the Information is Right:

Sometimes, you want to make sure users put the correct information. For example, you don't want them to leave the email box empty or type in something that's not a real email. Formik helps you set up rules to check if the information is correct.
Handle When Users Submit the Form:

When users press the submit button, Formik helps you do something with the information they provided. Maybe you want to send it to a server or show a message saying, "Thanks for signing up!" Formik helps with that process.
Show Errors When Something Goes Wrong:

If users make a mistake, like leaving the username box empty, Formik helps you show a friendly message saying, "Oops, you forgot your username!" It makes error messages easy.
No More Writing Lots of Code:

Formik gives you special tools (like Field and Form) to set up your form without writing a ton of complicated code. It's like having helpers that do a lot of the work for you.
